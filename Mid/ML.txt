ResNet ✅
DenseNet ✅
GradCAM++ (optional)
====================

Steps
====================
1. Dataset collect
2. Labeling
3. Image pre-processing (resize, random flip, gray scale)
4. Data split (training, testing etc.)
5. Fed into model (when training or validating don't touch the test dataset portion) - define epoch
   suppose 10 epoch, for each epoch give me accuracy score
   must generate training graph
6. Generate result (Accuracy, F1-score, Recall, Precision, Confusion Matrix)
   Generate test accuracy graph also
