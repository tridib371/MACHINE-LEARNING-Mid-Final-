## üìö Course Overview

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn from data and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

### Key Learning Objectives:
- Understand **supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning**.  
- Implement ML algorithms using **Python libraries**: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.  
- Evaluate models using **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix**.  
- Apply ML concepts to **real-world projects and datasets**.
